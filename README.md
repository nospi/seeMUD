# SeeMUD - Visual MUD Client

**Transform classic text-based MUDs into immersive visual experiences with AI-powered image generation.**

SeeMUD is an innovative MUD (Multi-User Dungeon) client that enhances traditional text-based gaming by automatically generating visual representations of game environments while preserving the classic gameplay experience.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Text Parsing** - Intelligent classification of room descriptions, items, and NPCs
- **Dynamic Image Generation** - Real-time visualisation of MUD environments using Stable Diffusion
- **Smart Caching** - Intelligent image caching with persistent storage across sessions
- **Auto-Mapping** - Automatic spatial mapping with 2-level neighbourhood awareness
- **Spatial Context** - Image generation leverages neighbouring room context for consistency
- **Three-Column Layout** - Independent resizable panels for output, map, and image display
- **Entity Detection** - Automatic identification and display of items and mobs in rooms

## Screenshots

*Coming soon - showing the three-column interface with MUD output, mini-map, and AI-generated room imagery*

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.23 or higher
- Node.js 16+ and npm (for frontend development)
- [Wails v2](https://wails.io/docs/gettingstarted/installation) installed
- Stable Diffusion API endpoint (default: `http://127.0.0.1:7860`)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/seeMUD.git
cd seeMUD

# Install dependencies
go mod download

# Build the application
wails build

# Or run in development mode
wails dev
```

### Configuration

Set the Stable Diffusion endpoint via environment variable:

```bash
export SEEMUD_SD_ENDPOINT="http://localhost:7860"
```

Or the endpoint will default to `http://127.0.0.1:7860`

### Running

After building, run the binary:

```bash
./build/bin/seemud-gui  # Linux/macOS
# or
./build/bin/seemud-gui.exe  # Windows
```

Or use the convenience script:

```bash
./launch.sh  # Development mode
./launch-binary.sh  # Production binary
```

## Usage

1. **Connect to MUD** - Enter host and port, click Connect
2. **Explore** - Move through rooms as normal (north, south, east, west, etc.)
3. **View Map** - Auto-generated mini-map shows current room and surroundings
4. **Generate Images** - Click "Generate Image" to visualise the current room
5. **Regenerate** - Don't like the image? Click "Regenerate" for a new version
6. **Custom Prompts** - Add custom style directions when regenerating images

## Architecture

SeeMUD uses a clean separation of concerns:

- **Telnet Client** - Handles MUD server connections
- **Parser** - Classifies MUD output (room titles, descriptions, exits, entities)
- **Mapper** - Builds spatial graph of rooms with intelligent duplicate handling
- **Renderer** - Generates images using Stable Diffusion with contextual prompts
- **Frontend** - React-based UI built with Wails framework

See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed architecture documentation.
